# Reminiscer of Dream
The first game development from Lalapinkbun

## Introduction
Hi! Lalapinkbun here, so here is the name of the game I'm developing is called **Reminiscer of Dream**!

Reminiscer of Dream is a 2D turn-based RPG game that incorporates a unique card system, adding complexity and diversity to the gameplay. The game features a storyline with multiple chapters, where players take on the role of the "Reminiscer" to explore the mysteries of the land known as the "Dreamscape Abyss".

## What Happen on this "new"?
Because the old version was made by very urgent at the time, it was not developed properly (there were a lot of bugs and I have literally no energy to solve them). So, I had planned to re-develop this game

You can still play the old version "concept game" here btw
